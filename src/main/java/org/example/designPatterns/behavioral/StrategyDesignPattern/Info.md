Strategy Design Pattern:

- It is used when we want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list.
- It is used when we want to choose an algorithm at runtime.
- It is used when we have multiple algorithms for a specific task and we want to choose any of the algorithms at runtime.
- It is used when we want to avoid conditional statements in the code.
- It is used when we want to remove the algorithm from the context and make it independent.
- It is used when we want to define a class that will have one behavior that is similar to other behaviors in a list.

Observer Design pattern:

- Observer design pattern is a behavioral design pattern.
- It is like kafka, where we have a producer and multiple consumers.
- It is used when we want to notify multiple objects about a change in the state of an object.
- It is a one-to-many relationship.
- It is used when we want to decouple the sender and receiver.
